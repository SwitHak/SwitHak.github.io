# INTRODUCTION
## Discovery and some stuff
BlueKeep or [CVE-2019-0708](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0708) is a vulnerability patched by Microsoft in its May 2019 Patch Tuesday. The vulnerability was reported by the UK National Cyber Security Centre but we don't know when. It means the vulnerability passed the Equity Process.
The Equity Process qualifies if a vulnerability must be kept by UK secret services or must be reported to the vendor) (https://www.gchq.gov.uk/information/equities-process).

Nota0: There is 2 scenario here:
- 0 : They've known the vuln since long time and used it against their targets (Maybe shared with allies too...)
- 1 : They discovered it and submited to Equity Process and the result was a report to Microsoft.
If you think you were a possible target for them, maybe doing some archeology in your packets capture can give you some surprise ;)

## Vulnerability
### Microsoft Advisory
From the microsoft advisory, here is the description:

"A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote Desktop Services – formerly known as Terminal Services – when an unauthenticated attacker connects to the target system using RDP and sends specially crafted requests.
This vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the target system.
An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the target systems Remote Desktop Service via RDP."

It means the vulnerability can be triggerred remotely, leading to an exploitation of the Remote Desktop Services – formerly known as Terminal Services –, giving at the end of the exploitation, the possibilityto gain a Remote Command Execution as NT/SYSTEM also know as the high privilege possible under a Windows system.

### Little introduction to RDP exchanges communications
The so much appreciated Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection sequence:

```
(01) [Client] ---------X.224 Connection Request----------------> [Server]
(02) [Client] <--------X.224 Connection Request----------------- [Server]
(02*) *Here the transport can switch from unencrypted to TLS*
(03) [Client] ---------MCS Connect Initial and GCC Create------> [Server]
(04) [Client] <--------MCS Connect Response and GCC Response---- [Server]
(05) [Client] ---------MCS Erect Domain Request----------------> [Server]
(06) [Client] ---------MCS Attach User Request-----------------> [Server]

## Countermeasures

### Enable Network Level Authentication [NLA]
#### Why ?
If you enable NLA, in the RDP exchange schema, attackers are stopped at step 1.

#### Supported Versions

On the server side:
- Windows 2008
- Windows 2008 R2
- Windows 7
- Windows Vista

On the client side:
- Windows XP SP3
- Windows Vista
- Windows 7
- Windows 2008
- Windows 2008 R2
- Remote Desktop Connection for Mac

#### How ?

- Server GPO
```
Computer Configuration
  Policies
    Administrative Templates
      Windows Components
        Remote Desktop Settings
          Remote Desktop Session Host
            Security
              Require user authentication for remote connections by using Network Level Authentication
               Enabled
                OK
```
- Client GPO
```
Computer Configuration
  Policies
    Administrative Templates
      Windows Components
        Remote Desktop Settings
          Remote Desktop Connection Client
            Configure Authentication for Client
              Enabled
                OK
```
#### SwiftOnSecurity Recommendations
[Swift On Security](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1132073274354147329) 

### Block 3389 trafic from the internet
I know, some people can't.
Author's  note: some specific configurations set the RDP to listen on another port number. Adapt your signatures and detections in consequences.

### Disable RDP services on your machines
If you don't used it, disable it.

## How to detect it?

### Network signatures
NCC group released a network signature using Suricata:
https://github.com/nccgroup/Cyber-Defence/blob/b2965daaa7bd89779bee95ad6b8c1bfed3821fda/Signatures/suricata/2019_05_rdp_cve_2019_0708.txt

EmergingThreats Labs released a network signature supporting Suricata and Snort:
- [Suricata](https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata/rules/emerging-exploit.rules)
- [Snort](https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/snort-2.9.0/rules/emerging-exploit.rules)

Author's  note: some specific configurations set the RDP to listen on another port number. Adapt your signatures and detections in consequences.

#### Network signatures detections limits
If the attacker requests a TLS connection, current network signatures aren't more relevant, because the trafic is encrypted.
Except if you have the ability to configure TLS interception on your sensors.
Talos Security published a guide to do it for Firepower sensors but i'm pretty sure it's supported by others vendors: https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/05/firepower-encrypted-rdp-detection.html

### The magic cookie name (zerosum0x0 default scanner)
As explained by @bromiley, @zerosum0x0 set up a cookie name in his scanner. This specific Cookie value is five random characters and has a protocol request of 0x00000000. Easy to spot with a network sig.

source: https://medium.com/@bromiley/what-happens-before-hello-ce9f29fa0cef

### The account name (zerosum0x0 default scanner)
As explained by @AdamTheAnalyst, @zerosum0x0 used for his scanner by default an interesting user account name "AAAAAAA" when someone use the default metasploit scan module against your device.
You can find this information in your logs under the Event ID 4625 (you need to have activated the logging, even for the missed authentification ones)
As people can change a little bit the default scanner values and if you have a strict user account name policy, you can create your own regex for this part based on your policy.

### Security Solutions Detections
#### Symantec
- 31527 [OS Attack: Microsoft Windows Desktop Services RCE CVE-2019-0708](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=31527)
- 31529 [OS Attack: Microsoft Windows Desktop Services RCE CVE-2019-0708 2](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=31529)

#### McAfee
0x47900c00 RDP: Microsoft Remote Desktop MS_T120 Channel Bind Attempt

#### Kaspersky
I'm confident Exploit Prevention (EP) is able to detect the attack, but I have no proof.

#### Fsecure
No public detection, you can scan your environment, use the plugin 1013880 for it.

#### Checkpoint
The protection is available in SandBlast Agent’s E80.97 Client Version (Can be downloaded from sk154432).
